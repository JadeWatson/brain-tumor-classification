# Brain Tumor Classification
Designed and developped multiple CNNs to classify brain tumours in a group of 4. Since it is a well researched area, we decided to explore 3 research questions in addition to explore the effects of image pre-processing and CNN model architecture on model complexity. In addition, to the jupyter notebook, I included the final report and presentation for an overview of the research performed and development of the models.
